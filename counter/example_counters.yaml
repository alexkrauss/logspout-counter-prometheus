# This file defines the set of counters. The counter will be incremented whenever the "match" string occurs in the line.
# The additional "level" attribute is passed as an extra label to the metric. Note that this is independent from the log
# level that may be used by the log source.
#
counters:
  hello:
    match: "Hello"
    level: "INFO"
  world:
    match: "World"
    level: "ERROR"
